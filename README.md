Introduction

    Our project explores the efficacy of various image segmentation techniques, specifically Unet, Segnet, and DeeplabV3, in the context of autonomous driving. We have used Unet as our baseline model and compared with Segnet, DeeplabV3 model. We also find another ResNet model to compare with the baseline to make sure our methods are better, which has been tested and shown in conclusion part of our project summary.

File Sturcture

    UNet.ipynb: This notebook contains the implementation details of the UNet model, including its architecture, training process, and evaluation methods.

    SegNet.ipynb: In this file, you can find a detailed implementation of the SegNet model, including network architecture, data processing, and performance testing.

    DeepLabV3.ipynb: This file details the construction and experimental results of the DeepLabV3 model.

    project summary.pdf: This document summarizes the overall progress of the project, including key findings for each model and the overall discussions/conclusions of the project.

Each ipynb document has been runned and shown the result, please check those results and contact our team members if you have any questions.
