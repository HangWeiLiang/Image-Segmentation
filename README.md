# Image Segmentation Project
## Overview: 
Our project explores the efficacy of various image segmentation techniques (in particular Unet, Segnet, and DeeplabV3) in the context of autonomous driving. We use Unet as the baseline model and compare with Segnet, DeeplabV3 models. We also found another ResNet model to compare with the baseline to ensure that our approach is better, this model has been tested and presented in the conclusion section of our project summary. In the end, the Deeplabv3 model achieved the best training results, with Accuracy reaching 87%.

## Dataset
The data set used in this project is the Indian driving data set on kaggle, which contains 5966 training data and 1016 validation data. The label image consists of 26 classes, and the pixel value 255 represents "unlabeled/out of roi" data.
